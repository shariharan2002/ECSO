# ECSO

We submit our algorithm "Evolutionary Constraint-aware algorithm for Submodular Optimization - ECSO" developed by :
1. Hariharan Subramanian - Indian Institute of Management, Mumbai/Georgia Institute of Technology
2. Reshma Chirayil Chandrasekharan - Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore

towards the Competition - Evolutionary Submodular Optimisation GECCO 2025!

We submit the algorithm for both low and high budget tracks. The program expects 2 parameters :problem_id and budget.
To run the algorithm against any problem id and budget please use the following sample command:

python ecso_v4.py --problem_id 2200 --budget 10000

The best solution shall be returned as soon as the budget is extinguished for fitness evaluations. 


Please do contact : shariharan2002bcce@gmail.com/hsubramanian35@gatech.edu if any error arises.

Thank You!
